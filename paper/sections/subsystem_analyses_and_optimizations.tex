With the system model integrated, subsystems must be analyzed prior to conducting top-level trade studies.
Multiple subsystems are under-constrained and require more information than is provided by the user to operate.
Prior to running trade studies, optimizations are performed on multiple subsystems
in order to select any values necessary to properly constrain the model.
The input values generated during subsystem optimization will be used when performing trade studies.
The methodology used to perform these optimizations is discussed in detail in this section.
Furthermore, subsystem analysis can provide critical insight into system level behavior.
The behavior of energy consumption, structural costs, and capacity scaling
can be begin to be observed through subsystem analysis,
then more fully developed through system level analysis.
Subsystem analyses that provide critical insight to system-level behavior are
discussed in this section as they begin to illustrate major conclusions.
